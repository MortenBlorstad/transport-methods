# Transport Methods

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with two powerful techniques of transport methods:

- **Normalizing Flows**
- **Triangular Transport Maps**

These methods enable efficient sampling, density estimation, and inference by transforming simple probability distributions into complex ones.
